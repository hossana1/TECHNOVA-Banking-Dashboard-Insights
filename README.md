Offer exclusive loyalty programs, luxury upgrades, or premium financing packages.

Use personalized marketing to retain and upsell to these customers.

Develop VIP customer tiers with perks tied to income or past purchases.

Introduce affordable vehicle models or used cars with flexible financing.

Consider subscription-based ownership models or short-term leasing.

Partner with community organizations for income-based incentive programs.
