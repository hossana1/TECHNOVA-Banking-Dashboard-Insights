### 📈 Recommendations for Growth & Optimization
# 1. Target High-Volume Cities for Expansion
Why: San Jose and San Francisco show the highest concentration of customers.
Action: Launch regional promotions, open new branches, or offer city-specific incentives.

# 2. Strengthen Customer Engagement During Low Transaction Months
Why: February and October see transaction dips.
Action: Introduce seasonal loan offers, cashback promotions, or holiday campaigns to boost activity.

# 3. Mitigate Risk from High Loan Exposure
Why: Loans ($127.51M) are 5x higher than account deposits ($25.30M).
Action: Rebalance portfolio by incentivizing savings or high-balance deposits. Launch high-yield savings accounts.

# 4. Leverage High-Value Customers
Why: Top 7 customers handle ~$4.2M in volume.
Action: Offer premium tiers, tailored financial products, or dedicated support. Use data analytics for targeted retention.

# 5. Cross-Sell Based on Account Type Balance
Why: Account type is nearly evenly split.
Action: Design cross-sell strategies—e.g., upsell credit cards or loans to savings customers and vice versa.
